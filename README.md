# project-eidolon
Eidolon is a fun project that scrapes random questions from stackoverlow, saves them to a mongoDB database and then displays it on a website.

# Inspiration
A friend asked me to build an app that will study for them while they did something else. So I tried to build something that can get you some resources before you begin studying.

# What it does
Eidolon scrapes random questions from StackOverflow, saves them to a MongoDB database, and then displays it on a website.

# How I built it
Built with Pycharm IDE. Pycharm helped with managing virtual environments.

# Challenges I ran into
- Connecting to MongoDB Atlas
- Generating Dynamic HTML content
- Connecting to MongoBD from Flask

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- Learned many new tools

# What I learned
- Full-stack web development with python
- Flask
- MongoDB
- Scrapy
I learned so many skills in under 24 hours! For the record, I've never built a real web app before - not even used flask before!

# What's next for Eidolon
- Host in the cloud.
- Add new features like a login system.
